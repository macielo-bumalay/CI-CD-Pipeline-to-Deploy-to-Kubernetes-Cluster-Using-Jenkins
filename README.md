# Building a CI/CD Pipeline with AWS, Jenkins, Docker, Ansible, Git, Github, Apache Maven, and Kubernetes
This article is designed to clarify the CI/CD process by putting theory into practice. We'll guide you through a detailed tutorial, systematically covering each module, enabling you to construct a CI/CD pipeline from scratch. To achieve this, we'll leverage the capabilities of modern DevOps tools such as AWS, Jenkins, Docker, Ansible, Git, Apache Maven, and Kubernetes. Let's embark on this learning journey together!

<h3>[Section 1]: AWS EC2 Virtual Server</h3>
This section is dedicated to the creation of an AWS EC2 Virtual Server instance. As part of this project, we will be setting up three EC2 instances for Jenkins, Ansible, and Kubernetes. We can revisit this module in "[Section 2]: Jenkins", â€œ[Section 5]: Ansible" and "[Section 7]: Kubernetes" sections.

<h3>[Section 2]: Jenkins Server</h3> 
Jenkins is a free and open source automation server. It helps automate the parts of software development related to building, testing, and deploying, facilitating continuous integration and continuous delivery. 

<h3>[Section 3]: Apache Maven</h3>

<h3>[Section 4]: Git and Github</h3>
Git is software for tracking changes in any set of files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively developing source code during software development. 

<h3>[Section 5]: Ansible </h3>
Ansible is an open-source software provisioning, configuration management, and application-deployment tool enabling infrastructure as code. 

<h3>[Section 6]: Docker </h3> 
Docker is a set of platform as a service products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers.

<h3>[Section 7]: Kubernetes </h3> 
Kubernetes is an open-source container-orchestration system for automating computer application deployment, scaling, and management.
